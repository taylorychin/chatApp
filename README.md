# Getting Started
[Open app](https://chat-app-tc.herokuapp.com//)

When First logging in the user is promted with a login/sign up page. If the user knows URLs that will lead to other pages and attempts to go directly to those they will be redirected to the login/signup page.
Once logged in the user is directed to the channel listing page where they can pick a channel and enter to room to chat with other users. The chat allows for css styling in text so users can change colors, fonts, font size etc.

# Next Steps
Given I would like to convert this program from a webpage into a stand alone program and have channels/users in a list on a sidebar instead of only getting notifications through the text channel.
